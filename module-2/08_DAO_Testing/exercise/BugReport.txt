Bug 1
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
createTimesheet_returns_timesheet_with_id_and_expected_values()

Expected output: 3

Actual output: 5

How did you fix this bug?
Realized this was testing for matching ID's as well. So I tested for the expected ID separately then altered IDs to match
and used the method assertTimesheetsEquals to confirm other values were as expected.


Bug 2
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
getBillableHours_returns_correct_total

Expected output: 0.0

Actual output: 2.0

How did you fix this bug?
I added "AND billable = true" to the sql.


Bug 3
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
getTimesheetsByEmployeeId_returns_list_of_all_timesheets_for_employee()

Expected output: 1

Actual output: 2

How did you fix this bug?
changed "if(results.next()){ " to "while(results.next()){ " that way it can run as many times as necessary rather than just the once.



Bug 4
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
getTimesheetsByProjectId_returns_correct_timesheets_for_project()

Expected output: 2

Actual output: 3

How did you fix this bug?
Swapped "WHERE employee_id = ? " with "WHERE project_id = ? "
